# Individual Analysis Proposal

## 1. What question are you trying to answer?

How do voter turnout trends in U.S. elections compare across different states, and what factors strongly correlate with changes in turnout?

## 2. Why is this question worth answering?

Understanding voter turnout trends is important because it directly impacts election results and the policies that follow. By analyzing these trends, people can identify obstacles to voting and develop strategies to encourage greater participation. Additionally, this topic remains highly relevant, as voter turnout is frequently discussed in the media and political discourse.

For example, in the recent 2024 U.S. presidential election, news outlets and political analysts have focused on numerous issues that influence voter turnout. By examining the dataset, the analysis can provide a clearer, evidence-based understanding of how voter turnout trends changed over previous years.

## 3. What is your hypothesis?

My hypothesis is that states with more restrictive voting laws will show lower voter turnout due to it possibilty affecting low-income and minority voters. Also, I expect that battleground states will experience higher turnout due to increased campaign efforts, voter engagement initiatives, and competitiveness.

## 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question?

The dataset was found using Kaggle, and it was sourced from a project called OpenElections. The dataset provides comprehensive election results at the national, state, and precinct levels. It includes detailed records of voter participation and election outcomes.
